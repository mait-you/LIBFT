## Overview

`libft` is a custom library written in C that includes various standard library functions and additional utilities. This project is designed to strengthen skills in C programming by developing commonly used functions from scratch, enabling a better understanding of how they work under the hood.

## Features

- A collection of recreated C standard library functions.
- Helper functions for string manipulation, memory management, and linked list operations.
- Built with memory safety and efficiency in mind.
- Foundation for many C-based projects in the 42 curriculum.

## Installation

To compile `libft`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
   cd libft
   ```
2. Compile the library:

  ```bash
   make
  ```
  This will generate the libft.a file, which can be linked to your C projects.

## Usage

To use libft in your project, include it as follows:

  1. Add the libft.a file to your project's directory.

  2. Link the library during compilation. For example:

  ```bash√•
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.c -L. -lft -o my_program
  ```
  3. Include the libft.h header in your code to access the functions:
  ```c
    #include "libft.h"
  ```

## Functions

### String Manipulation

- **`ft_strlen`**: Calculate the length of a string.
- **`ft_strcpy`**: Copy a string to another location.
- **`ft_strcat`**: Concatenate two strings.
- **`ft_strchr`**: Find the first occurrence of a character in a string.

### Memory Management

- **`ft_memset`**: Fill a memory area with a constant byte.
- **`ft_memcpy`**: Copy data from one memory area to another.
- **`ft_bzero`**: Set all bytes in a memory area to zero.

### Character Checks

- **`ft_isalpha`**: Check if a character is alphabetic.
- **`ft_isdigit`**: Check if a character is numeric.
- **`ft_isalnum`**: Check if a character is alphanumeric.

### Linked List Utilities

- **`ft_lstnew`**: Create a new linked list node.
- **`ft_lstadd`**: Add a new node to a linked list.
- **`ft_lstdel`**: Delete a node in a linked list.

Add any additional functions you've implemented here for easy reference.
